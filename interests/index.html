			<h2>Passion 1: Music</h2>

			<p>I have always been passionate about music. I started playing
				instruments at a young age. Going from the recorder in 3rd grade, 
				to the clarinet in 4th grade, and then onto the alto saxophone in
				5th grade, I enjoyed getting to know more and more instruments. 
				I stuck with the saxophone for 6 years and only stopped playing due to time 
				constraints brought on by school. If I was able to afford a saxophone 
				of my own and private lessons, I would definitely resume playing. During 
				my years as a budding musician, I had the honor of getting to interact 
				and play with many amazing people. I worked with renowned musicians such as 
				Virigina Mayhew, Oscar Perez, Kelly Green, Bruce Williams, and more. I performed 
				for the Nikil Badlani Foundation annually and also took part in concerts put on 
				by Jazz House Kids. Although I stopped playing in bands around 2020, that did not
				dim my love for music. I registered up for my first Spotify account during 
				8th grade in 2016 and I have been a loyal user ever since. Music is apart of my daily
				life and I want to keep it that way as I search for a career.</p>
