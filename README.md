# PORTFOLIOFinalDraft112723

When it comes to coding, the most experience I have with it is when I took a beginner's class back in highschool. I struggled learning to code back then and I neer thought I would revisit it. Having to use html & css in this class proved to be just as much of a challenge as I remember coding to do. Luckily with the textbook, tutroials, help from peers, and more, this time around was much more doable. 
I initally wanted to take a more creative route with this website project, however; my ideas for that were all over the place and I decided to do a classic portfolio.
